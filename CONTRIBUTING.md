# Contributor Guidelines

Make sure your code actually works. 

LLMs are ok as a helper as long as the actual code is written and vetted by you,
but if you're just going to use LLMs to "solve the issue" mindlessly, don't!!! Just create an issue and I will fix the problem.

If you still make AI slop PRs that don't even work. You will be blocked globally by me as I have limited time to maintain my 
projects and bad faith contributions take the limited time I could've used on more productive endeavors and I can't really be sure that you won't
do it again in the future.
